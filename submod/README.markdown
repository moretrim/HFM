Ported HPM Dismantlement
========================

Description
-----------

This is a Victoria 2 submod meant to be overlaid on top of HFM. It is unlikely to work well or at all with other mods
based on HFM as the functionality provided by this submod requires modifying some fairly important files.

Due to the latter reason this submod also incorporates the option to disable colonial railroading. See the features down
below.

Installation
------------

Grab the [0.1.0 release].

[0.1.0 release]: https://github.com/moretrim/HFM/releases/tag/ported-hpm-dismantlement-0.1.0

Install this as you would any other mod. When installed properly, the `ported_hpm_dismantlement.mod` file and
the `ported-hpm-dismantlement` directory should live side-by-side with the respective `.mod` file and directory of the
underlying mod.

In the Victoria 2 launcher you should see an entry for the submod:

![launcher](./launcher.jpg)

The `50: ` prefix should ensure that the submod appears *before* the underlying mod. If it doesn't the submod is
unlikely to work at all. (For advanced use, this prefix can be modified to tweak load order.) Make sure you are loading
*both* the submod & the underlying mod (in the picture that's stock HFM), as indicated by the check marks.

Once a game has been started you can verify that the submod has been loaded correctly by looking at the decision screen.
It should include the following decision somewhere near the top of the list of decisions:

![decision](./decision.png)

You can click the decision at any time to harmlessly dismiss it.

Features
--------

### Optional Colonial Raidroading

This submod incorporates an option to disable colonial railroading ([HFM PR #157]). This option is not enabled by
default should the player wish to play by the same rules as in base HFM 1.27I.

### Ported HPM Features

Ported features are based on [HPM 0.4.5.2]. They are:

[HPM 0.4.5.2]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/tree/v0.4.5.2

- Add the organisation decisions, e.g. the decisions to show/hide government decisions. Without HPM's array of decisions
  though this doesn't do much.

- Updated colonial organisation decisions. Relative to HFM, these are now usually taken later in the game.

- Updated colonial RGO decisions when organising a colony, allowing the country to tailor colony output to their needs.

- Updated dismantlement. Relative to HFM this means:

  * proper dismantlement of Indian lands & satellites
  * proper dismantlement of Indonesian lands
  * cleaner dismantlements of colonies, e.g. returning Namibian lands to whichever country is in charge of the colony of
    Namibia (regardless of status during the dismantlement war)
  * infamy costs when entire countries (colonial or otherwise) change hands are based on population
  * better player control of dismantlements, as vassal countries & countries which have lost *any* war in the past 5
    years are ineligible for dismantlement spoils (in particular: settling for a white peace counts as losing a war)

These features also come with bugfixes which have been submitted upstream ([HPM/#39], [HPM/#40]).

[HPM/#39]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/pull/39
[HPM/#40]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/pull/40

Note that this port does *not* include e.g. the updated colonial CB system of HPM.

Known Issues
------------

Some things have not been brought up to speed and may result in new & possibly unexpected behaviour:

- During dismantlement some countries may not end where they would in either HFM or HPM. They can end up independent, or
  be improperly annexed by a country including the dismantled power.

  This includes Egypt, which is known to become independent in some circumstances.

- Colonial countries (e.g. Nigeria, Indonesia) may not civilise on time, or at all.

Remarks To Mod Makers
---------------------

If you are interested in incorporating HPM features by using some or all of the changes included in this submod, I would
urge caution. This submod works by porting some HPM features piecemealâ€”because it is intended as a stopgap.

This author is of the opinion that HFM would benefit better from HPM 0.4.\* features through proper merging. This submod
in fact started as a project to study how hard such a merge would be, to which my tentative conclusion is: though
time-consuming it should be doable, certainly at least for large swathes of the mod. However because this submod is
limited in scope it ended up not being written like that.

In the eventuality that such a merge ever happens the changes present in this submod are likely to be obsolete and
conflicting. For this reason all I suggest to anyone that incorporates them is to ensure that all changes are easily
revertible.

In addition most if not all design decisions taken in the writing of this submod are documented through comments (e.g.
'HPM 0.4.5.2 port: bugfix').
